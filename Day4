#for addressing this question: Which brand has highest CO2 emission for same vehicle class?
#Solution to yesterday's problem, Hurray!

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv('/home/kishor/PycharmProjects/my_hello_world/vehicle.csv')
#print (df['VEHICLECLASS'])
a =[]
lbl =[] # initializing array
for row, r in df.iterrows():
            for x in r:
                if x=='COMPACT':
                    print('\n', r['CO2EMISSIONS'])
                    a = np.append(a, r['CO2EMISSIONS'])

                        b = r

import plotly.express as px
fig = px.line(df, lbl, a, labels = { 'lbl' : 'Vehicle Name', 'a': 'CO2 Emissions'}, title= 'COMPACT vehicle class with their corresponding CO2 emissions')
fig.show()
print ('Vehicle with maximum CO2 emission with vehicle class COMPACT is: \n', b)

# Same process can be applied for finding minimum CO2 emission. Only task that need to be done is by replacing  max(a) with min (a) in line 14, Happy Coding!
