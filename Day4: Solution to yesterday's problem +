#for addressing this question: Which brand has highest CO2 emission for same vehicle class?
#Solution to yesterday's problem, Hurray!

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.read_csv('/home/kishor/PycharmProjects/my_hello_world/vehicle.csv')
#print (df['VEHICLECLASS'])
a =[]
lbl =[] # initializing array
for row, r in df.iterrows():
            for x in r:
                if x=='COMPACT':
                    print('\n', r['CO2EMISSIONS'])
                    a = np.append(a, r['CO2EMISSIONS'])
                    lbl = np.append(lbl, (r['MAKE'] + ' ' + r ['MODEL']))
                    if max(a)== r['CO2EMISSIONS']:
                        b = r

import plotly.express as px
fig = px.line(df, lbl, a, labels = { 'lbl' : 'Vehicle Name', 'a': 'CO2 Emissions'}, title= 'COMPACT vehicle class with their corresponding CO2 emissions')
fig.show()
print ('Vehicle with maximum CO2 emission with vehicle class COMPACT is: \n', b)

# Same process can be applied for finding minimum CO2 emission. Only task that need to be done is by replacing  max(a) with min (a) in line 14, Happy Coding!

# Learning continues for day 4!
# Time for Logistic Regression!
# So firsst task of mine was getting used to sigmoid function. Hence I generated values for sigmoid function and plotted it. Code is given below:

import math as mt
arr = []
lbl = []
for i in range (-100,100):
    fun = 1 / (1 + mt.exp(-i))
    arr.append(fun)
    lbl.append(i)
    print ( fun)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(lbl, arr)
plt.title('Sigmoid Function Plot')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Sigmoid Function')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
