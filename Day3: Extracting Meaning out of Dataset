#My primary goal of this code are to get answers on following
#Which model of vehicle has highest CO2 emission?
#Which brand has highest CO2 emission for same vehicle class?
#Which model of vehicle has highest CO2 emission for same engine size?
#Which model of vehicle has lowest/highest average fuel consumption?
#Is there any relationship between fuel consumption and CO2 emission?

print ('Entire row of Engine size is \n', df['ENGINESIZE'])
print ('Maximum value of CO2 emission with max() function: \n',(df['CO2EMISSIONS']).max())
print ('Minimum value of CO2 emission with min() function: \n',(df['CO2EMISSIONS'].min()))

#First Way
print('Display the entire row which have maximum value by using bool expression  and max() function: \n ', df[df['CO2EMISSIONS']==df['CO2EMISSIONS'].max()]) #Display the entire row which have maximum value

#Second Way
print('\n The Vehicle with maximum CO2 emission  by using argmax() function is: \n', df.iloc[df.CO2EMISSIONS.argmax()]) #Even easier way to get details of the row which have maximum value of certain feature
print('\n The vehicle with minimum CO2 emission by argmin() function is : \n', df.iloc[df.CO2EMISSIONS.argmin()])

#defining function for calculating total of any row

    total = 0
    for i in df[name]:
        total +=i
    return  total

print ('Total fuel consumption in city is : ', sum_row('FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY'))

#By using len() function
print('Total number or rows in the file is: ', len(df)+1)

#By using shape[] function, shape[0] is for number of row whereas shape[1] is for number of column
print('Total number or rows in the file is: ', df.shape[0]+1)

#For number of column
print('Total number or column in the file is: ', df.shape[1]) # No need to do +1 because column count does not start with 0

#function for calculating average of any row
def avg (name):
    average = sum_row(name)/(df.shape[0]+1)
    return  average

print('The average fuel consumption in the city is : ', avg('FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY'))

#Another simple method to generate mean
print (df.mean())

#Now, for addressing this question: Which brand has highest CO2 emission for same vehicle class?
#Say the class is compact for now, later on I will try to make a function as I made for getting total and average of any row
#I am facing problem in answering above question. I will solve it soon!
